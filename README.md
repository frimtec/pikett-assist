## Features

### PAssist is controlled by your calendar

PAssist activates and deactivates itself based on your calendar. All supervision features are only
running, when PAssist is activated. PAssist activates some time (configurable pre-/ post-run time)
before and keeps activated some time after the events start and stop time. This ensures you won't
miss an alert in case of a small time discrepancy between the operations center time and your phone
time.
All calendar events matching a configured title pattern are considered as on-call events.
PAssist shows you an overview with all future on-call events on the calendar tab.

### Alarming

If an SMS is received from your configured operations center, PAssist will race an alert.
It is playing a configured ringtone and starts a vibration pattern until you confirm it with a swipe button.
When confirmed, an acknowledgement is send back to your operations center.
The alarm goes into the confirmed alarm state and can be finally closed when all your support activities are completed.

### Alarm log

PAssist creates an alarm log with the start and end time of each incident.
All SMS messages received between start and end time are attached to the alarm in the log.
On the alert log tab you see all your passed alerts in an overview. Selecting an entry shows the details of an
alert incident including current state, reaction time to confirm, duration from start to end and all
received SMS
messages.
The alert log can be exported/imported from/to the external file system.

### Phone signal strength

PAssist will supervise the phone signal strength and notifies you with a vibration pattern if the
signal strength
is bad or off (includes airplane mode).
This ensures that you won't stay in a dead spot without recognize it during on-call duties.

![None signal state info](images/PAssist_no_signal.png)

### Battery level

PAssist will supervise the battery level and notifies if it is below a configured minimum level.

### Ringtone volume

PAssist can control the ringtone volume during on-call duty with separate profiles for day and
night.

### Test alarms

If the SMS alarming system in use sends daily test alarms to verify the alarming chain from end to end, PAssist can be
configured to automatically receive and acknowledge them, without interrupting the user.
On a configured daily check time, PAssist verifies if the expected test alarms have been received. If not, PAssist will
race an alert with a configured ringtone and starts a vibration pattern until you confirm the
missing test alarm with a
swipe button.
Test alarms can be configured for different contexts, as your alarming system may send a test alarms
for various systems
that are under supervision.

### Self build

Build PAssist on your own and then install the APK via ADB to your android phone.

### SMS permissions

In order to perform the functions of PAssist, PAssist needs to be able to receive and send SMS.
As these SMS permissions are no more granted by Google, a compatible SMS adapter is required.

Currently the only supported SMS adapter is [secure-sms-proxy][secure-sms-proxy-readme].
PAssist will guide you to install this SMS adapter.

PAssist also supports operations centers using numeric and alphanumeric short code SMS numbers.
Numeric short codes are currently only supported for the following countries:

* Belgium (BE)
* Botswana (BW)
* Brazil (BR)
* Canada (CA)
* Chile (CL)
* Denmark (DK)
* Dominican Republic (DO)
* Finland (FI)
* France (FR)
* Germany (DE)
* Greece (GR)
* Hungary (HU)
* India (IN)
* Indonesia (ID)

* Spain (ES)
* Sweden (SE)
* Switzerland (CH)
* Turkey (TR)
* USA (US)
* United Kingdom (GB)

Alphanumeric short codes are supported in any country.

Numeric short codes can be defined as normal phone numbers in the operations centers contact.
Ensure that no separator characters (like '-') are used.

As contacts in Android cannot contain alphanumeric short code phone numbers, they can be configured
in the contact field "Company".
If the operations centers uses several alphanumeric short code phone numbers, they can be comma
separated in the contacts "Company" field.
Any regular phone numbers stored in the contacts field "Company" will be ignored.

![Operations center contact with two alphanumeric short code SMS numbers](images/Contacts-with-alphanumeric-short-codes.png)

Be aware that confirmation replies are not possible if alphanumeric short code SMS numbers are used.

#### Acknowledgement method

##### Confirmation reply (for method: SMS with static text)

Defines the static text to send back as the confirmation reply to your operations center.

##### Confirmation reply extraction pattern (for method: SMS with dynamic text)

[Regular expression][regular-expression] pattern with one group to extract a confirmation value from
the received SMS
that will be used as the confirmation reply and sent back to your operations center.<br>
_WARNING_: If the pattern can not extracted a value from the received SMS, no acknowledgment is send
back to your operations center!

#### Auto confirm

New alerts are automatically confirmed if received within the defined time window after the last
alarm was received, while the app is still in a confirmed alert state.
This feature ensures you can stay focused on your current case even with recurring alerts.
If set to 0 (default), alarms are never auto confirmed.

#### SMS ignore filter

[Regular expression][regular-expression] pattern to identify SMS messages
to be ignored.
If empty, SMS filtering is disabled.<br>
_WARNING_: Be careful, if the pattern is not well designed and triggers for a real alarm, you won't be alerted!

#### Alarm ringtone

Defines the ringtone that is used to alert for on-call alarms.

#### Calendar filter

Defines one specific or all of your calenders, that should be used to look for on-call events.

#### Event filter

Defines a [Regular expression][regular-expression] pattern (case insensitive) to
match the titles of your calendar events, which should be considered for your on-call duties.

#### Extract partner contacts from events

Defines whether partner contacts are extracted from on-call duty events.

#### Extraction pattern for partner contacts

Defines a [Regular expression][regular-expression] pattern to
extract partner contacts from on-call duty events.
The partner contacts are extracted from the notes field of on-call duty events.
There can be several partner contacts in the event notes.  
The extracted partner contacts are interpreted as contact nicknames.

#### Pre- /post-run time

Time in seconds to enable/disable the on-call state before and after the calender event.
The default is 300 seconds (five minutes).

#### Supervise signal strength

Selects whether or not to monitor signal strength.
If the battery level drops below 10%, the monitoring interval will be reduced in favour of a longer
period.
remaining time.

#### Minimal signal strength

Defines the lowest accepted signal strength level.

#### Signal filter

Defines the amount of seconds for which the signal strength must be lower than the minimal expected
level before a low
signal alarm is raced.
With filtering you can reduce false alarms.
The filter can be set between 0 (filtering off) and 10 minutes, with a default of 30 seconds.
Be aware: With higher values, it takes longer until you are notified of a dead spot.
Even with filtering enabled, the airplane mode is detected immediately.

#### Alert with notification

Defines whether an alert for low signal strength creates a notification or not.
The phone also shows a low signal strength through a vibration pattern, regardless of this setting.

#### Supervised subscription (for Dual SIM only)

For dual SIM phones you can select the subscription for which the signal strength is supervised.

#### Supervise battery level

Defines whether the battery level is supervised or not.

#### Minimal battery level

Defines the minimal battery level in percentage (between 10% - 50%).
If the current battery level falls below this minimal level, a alert notification is created.
Independent of the this minimal battery level, whenever the battery level is in the danger zone
(below 10%) the polling interval for PAssist checks (e.g. signal strength) is lowered to minimize
the power consumption.

### Test alarm settings

[Regular expression][regular-expression] pattern to identify SMS alarm messages as test alarms (case
sensitive).<br>
_WARNING_: Be careful, if the pattern is not well designed and triggers for a real alarm, you won't be alerted!

The regular expression can define a group to extract the test context (for example the name of the
system) out of the
SMS.
As an example the following regular expression could handle test alarms from two different systems 'Helios' and 'Lunar':

`^Test alarm for system (Helios|Lunar).*`

Test alarms of each group can be supervised individually.

#### Test contexts to supervise

Defines which of the available test contexts should be supervised.

#### Check time

Defines the daily time on which the check occurs whether the test alarms have been received recently or not.
